# react-media-query-hoc
A dead simple React Higher Order Component (HOC) that uses context for matching media queries

# Why ?
- Easy to test:
- Performance: you can wrap your whole parent component in the HOC - and only have `matchMedia` event listeners firing for the number of screens you wish to configure

# Usage

# Thanks

Big thanks to https://github.com/jxnblk/react-media-context/ which is simular but its not a HOC & I wanted a simpler API which also used `matchmedia` internally
